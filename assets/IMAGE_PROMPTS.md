## 1. hero-banner.png (800x400)

**Prompt:**
```
A friendly 4-DOF robot arm on a desk, waving hello. The robot arm is small, white/clear acrylic with visible servo motors. It has an ESP32 microcontroller board at its base with blue LED lights. The arm is in a waving position with its gripper open like a hand. Background shows a modern workspace with warm lighting. Style: clean, modern, tech product photography, slight glow effect around the robot. No humans in frame.

## 2. emotion-grid.png (700x500)

**Prompt:**
```
A 3x3 grid showing the same small robot arm in 9 different emotional poses:
1. Waving happily
2. Drooping sadly
3. Bouncing excitedly
4. Pointing forward confidently
5. Shrugging with uncertainty
6. Saluting respectfully
7. Retreating shyly
8. Shaking angrily
9. Thinking/pondering

Each pose in its own panel with soft colored background matching the emotion (yellow=happy, blue=sad, etc). Clean illustration style, cute robot aesthetic.

## 4. gesture-showcase.png (800x600)

**Prompt:**
```
Horizontal strip showing 6 robot arm poses in sequence:
1. Wave - arm raised, gripper open waving
2. Salute - arm bent at "forehead"
3. Point - arm extended pointing forward
4. Dance - dynamic pose mid-movement
5. Bow - arm lowered respectfully
6. Celebrate - arm pumping up in victory

## 5. emotion-demo.gif (600x400) - Animated

**Description:**
A looping GIF showing the robot arm transitioning through emotions:
1. Start at home position

4. Think/ponder
5. Celebrate
6. Return to home

Smooth transitions, 3-4 seconds per gesture, loop seamlessly.

## Alternative: ASCII Art Placeholders

If AI-generated images aren't available, use these ASCII art placeholders:

```
    EXPRESSIVE ROBOT ARM

         ___
        /   \     <- Gripper
       |  O  |
        \___/
          |
         /=\      <- Elbow
        /   \
       |     |
        \   /     <- Shoulder
         | |
    _____|_|_____
   |  [ESP32]    | <- Base
